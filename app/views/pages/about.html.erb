    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      AirShare connects private pilots with passengers to make private aviation more
      accessible and efficient. We believe in creating a community where pilots can
      share their passion for flying while helping others reach their destinations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How It Works</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Pilots can list their flights and available seats, while passengers can browse
      and book flights that match their travel needs. Our platform handles all the
      booking logistics, making it easy for both pilots and passengers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Safety First</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Safety is our top priority. All pilots on AirShare must maintain valid licenses
      and certifications. We regularly verify credentials and maintain high standards
      for aircraft maintenance and operation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Community Values</h2>

      aviation. Whether you're a pilot or passenger, you're part of making private
      flying more accessible to everyone.
